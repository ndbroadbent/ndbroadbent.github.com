I am indebted to the collective Internet. My workflow and even thought process mostly consists of "problem -&gt; google -&gt; forum/blog -&gt; solution".

After months .. or even years .. of scabbing from other peoples forum posts and blogs, I finally have my own place to share solutions and hopefully help other people who are struggling .. This is going to be a scrapbook of errors and headaches, solutions and links. And hopefully a few of my posts will help some people out.
