I've been working with git for about 2 years, and I would like to share everything that I've
done to make life easier.

My git toolbox has expanded quite a lot since I wrote my other tiny posts
about git [shortcuts](http://madebynathan.com/2010/05/20/git-shortcuts/index.html)
and [functions](http://madebynathan.com/2010/10/29/more-git-shortcuts-filepaths-in-bash-variables/index.html).
So even if you've already seen a lot of blog posts like this one, I hope you will find at least
one or two things useful.

Here's what I will be covering:

* A definitive guide to git aliases and shortcuts
* Using enviroment variables as temporary file shortcuts with <code>git status</code>
* Fast switching between git repositories
* Managing design assets within projects


## A definitive guide to git aliases and shortcuts

Every alias has tab-completion.

Some of the longer aliases might look like overkill, but they really are useful.

When I've committed something, but need to make a small change

alias gcamh='git add -A; git commit --amend -C HEAD'

Keyboard shortcuts
Functions for resolving merge conflicts


## Fast switching between git repositories




## Managing design assets within projects
