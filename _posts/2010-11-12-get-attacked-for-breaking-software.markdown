At work, we use software called Atlassian Bamboo. It does CI (continuous integration) for us, so whenever a developer updates the code, it will run all of the software's tests, and makes sure everything still works.

We had a USB Missile launcher lying around, and I thought it could be put to good use. So now, whenever a developer commits a change that breaks a test, he gets shot.

The launcher is a bit wimpy though. I'd like to replace the springs with some more powerful ones, since the darts only get about half way to Steve's desk :P

UPDATE:

I attached a webcam and set it to record a video every time a missile was fired. Heres a link to the latest video:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK1p7Nz5c9s
