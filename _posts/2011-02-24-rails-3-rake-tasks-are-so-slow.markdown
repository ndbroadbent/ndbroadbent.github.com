When you run a rake task for a Rails 3 project, it has to load the entire environment since gems can include their own rake tasks. I started to get annoyed by this, because every capistrano deployment would load up rails on my environment just to notify hoptoad.

If you have a very simple rake task that is called very often, you might want to add some work-around code to check for it in the very beginning of your Rakefile. You might even want to bypass rake entirely, and put the code in a file in ./scripts. 

Here is an example for way faster hoptoad notifications (this cut our deploy time in half):

{% highlight ruby %}
# Speed up hoptoad:deploy by not loading rails environment
if ARGV[0] == "hoptoad:deploy"
  require 'active_support/core_ext/string'
  require 'hoptoad_notifier'
  require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'config', 'initializers', 'hoptoad')
  require 'hoptoad_tasks'
  HoptoadTasks.deploy(:rails_env      => ENV['TO'],
                      :scm_revision   => ENV['REVISION'],
                      :scm_repository => ENV['REPO'],
                      :local_username => ENV['USER'],
                      :api_key        => ENV['API_KEY'])
  exit
end
{% endhighlight %}

There are other ways to speed up rake, such as <a href="https://github.com/outoftime/rake_server">Rake Server</a> (which forks a Rails server process each time you invoke a rake task).

But sometimes quick hacks just work best.
