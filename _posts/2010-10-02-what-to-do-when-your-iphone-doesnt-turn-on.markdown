I was working on a MobileSubstrate project last night, and crashed Springboard. MobileSubstrate recovered, though, and told me to reboot or restart Springboard.

First lesson: Always reboot your iPhone and uninstall your package if Springboard crashes.

So yeah, I didn't listen, and thought it would be ok to keep debugging and try again. However, after a few minutes, my screen went black... permanently. The power button didn't do anything, and the home button didn't do anything. Plugging it in didn't do anything. I freaked out and thought I had bricked my iPhone.

I realized in the morning that the crash must have frozen iOS, and so now I just had to wait for the battery to drain. Luckily enough, I only had about 10% battery when it crashed, so it turned itself off at about lunchtime, and I could restart the phone.

So if your iPhone doesn't turn on, it might just mean that its frozen and you actually can't turn it off. To test for this you could unscrew the two screws at the bottom, physically remove the battery, and then put it back. But don't do that unless you have already voided your warranty, of course.
