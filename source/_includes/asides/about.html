    Hi, I'm Nathan Broadbent. I develop web and mobile applications. I enjoy working with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>.
    I'm currently CTO & Co-Founder at <a href="http://hdwr.co" target="_blank">HDWR</a>.
    This blog is where I post things about web/mobile development, and the projects I do in my spare time.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <strong>I'm  currently available for hire.</strong>
    I am looking for some part-time remote work, up to 20 hours per week. Please get in touch if need help building a web application or iOS app.
