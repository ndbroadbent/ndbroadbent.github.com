<div style="text-align: center;">

<p style="margin:20px;">This is just a little idea I had on the bus.</p>

    <img class="lightbox thumb" src="/images/posts/2011/03/IMG_0465.jpg" />


<p style="margin:20px;">Outside my apartment, I have a bucket for umbrellas.</p>

    <img class="lightbox thumb" src="/images/posts/2011/03/IMG_0469.jpg" />


<p style="margin:20px;">A program checks the local weather on <a href="http://www.weather.com">weather.com</a>
from time to time. If there's any chance of rain, it switches on the lights installed in the bucket.</p>

    <img class="lightbox thumb" src="/images/posts/2011/03/IMG_0468.jpg" />


<p style="margin:20px;">So when I walk out the door, I know whether or not I should take an umbrella to work.</p>
