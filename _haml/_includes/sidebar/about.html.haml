    Hi, I'm Nathan. I'm a full-time volunteer at a non-profit in Hong Kong called
    <a href="http://www.crossroads.org.hk">Crossroads</a>.
    I make websites with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>.
    This blog is where I post the things I learn at work,
    and the projects that I do in my spare time.
