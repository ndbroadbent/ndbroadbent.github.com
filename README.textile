h3. A blog about ruby, rails, linux, iphone, electronics

Hi, I'm Nathan Broadbent.
I'm a full-time volunteer at a non-profit organization in Hong Kong called Crossroads.
I make websites with Ruby on Rails.
This blog is where I post the stuff I learn at work, and projects that I do in my spare time.
