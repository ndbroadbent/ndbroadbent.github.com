h1. "MadeByNathan.com":http://madebynathan.com

h3. A "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll blog about ruby, rails, linux, iphone, electronics

I'm a full-time volunteer at a non-profit in Hong Kong called "Crossroads":http://www.crossroads.org.hk,
where I make websites with Ruby on Rails.

This blog is where I post the things I learn at work, and the projects that I do in my spare time.

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.
